# REPORT on LLVM
- LLVM uses a simple low-level language with strictly defined semantics and has full support
for accurate garbage collection. It includes front-ends for C and C++ and aggressive
optimizer. It supports a life-long compilation model like link-time, install-time, run-time, and
offline optimization. The LLVM code generator is relatively easy and makes use of a
powerful target description language. 
- It has extensive documentation and has hosted
many projects of various sorts and is claimed to be easy to work with and develop for. LLVM
is under active development (being extended, enhanced and improved). For example, front-
ends of few languages like Java, Scheme are in development.
- Clang is one of the primary subprojects of LLVM. Clang is a real-world, production quality
compiler with simple and hackable code base. It provides a language front-end and tooling
infrastructure for languages like C, C++ for the LLVM project. It aims in fast compilation,
low memory usage, producing useful error and warning messages. Extremely useful tools like
Clang Static Analyzer and clang-tidy (tools to automatically find bugs in code) can be built
using Clang front-end as a library to parse C/C++ code. 
- It is modular library-based
architecture supporting diverse clients like refactoring, static analysis, code generation and
also allows tight integration with IDEs. Clang is used in production to build performance-
critical software like Chrome, Firefox.
- By default, Clang builds C++ code according to the C++98 standard, with many C++11,
C++14, C++17 features accepted as extensions.

### C++11 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
Clang 3.3 and all later implements of the ISO C++ 2011 standard.
Clang&#39;s C++11 mode can be used with the -std=c++11 option or  libc++  or with gcc&#39;s
libstdc++.

### C++14 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
Clang 3.4 and all later implements of the ISO C++ 2014 standard.
Clang’s C++14 mode can be used with the -std=c++14 option (use -std=c++1y in Clang 3.4
and earlier).

## CLASS HIERARCHY
A class hierarchy or inheritance tree is a classification of object types, denoting objects as the
instantiations of classes inter-relating the various classes by relationships such as &quot;inherits&quot;,
&quot;extends&quot;, &quot;is an abstraction of&quot;, &quot;an interface definition&quot;.
Detailed information about Class Hierarchy in LLVM is in the following link

## DESIGN
In an LLVM-based compiler we have three-phase design whose major parts are front end, the
optimizer and the back end.
Front end is responsible for parsing, validating and diagnosing errors in the input code, then
the parsed code is translated into LLVM IR.
This IR is optionally fed through a series of analysis and optimization passes which improve
the code’s running time and is usually independent of language and target.
Then back-end maps the code onto the target instruction set and is responsible for generating
good code that takes advantage of unusual features of the supported architecture.
